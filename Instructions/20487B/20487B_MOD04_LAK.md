# Lab: Extending Travel Companion&#39;s ASP.NET Web API Services

### Exercise 1: Creating a Dependency Resolver for Repositories

#### Task 1: Change the FlightController constructor to support injection

1. In the **20487B-SEA-DEV-A** virtual machine, on the Start screen, click the **Visual Studio 2012** tile.
2. On the **File** menu, point to **Open** , and then click **Project/Solution**.
3. Browse to D:\Allfiles\Mod04\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Companion.
4. Select the file **BlueYonder.Companion.sln** and then click **Open**.
5. In Solution Explorer, under BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers project, double-click LocationsController.cs.
6. Replace the **LocationsController** constructor method with the following code:

   ```cs
        public LocationsController (ILocationRepository locations)
        {
           Locations = locations;
        }
```
7. Press Ctrl+S to save the file.

>**Note:** The same pattern was already applied in the starter solution for the rest of the controller classes ( **TravelersController** , **FlightsController** , **ReservationsController** , and **TripsController** ).  
Open those classes to review the constructor definition.

#### Task 2: Create a dependency resolver class

1. In Solution Explorer, double-click **BlueYonderResolver.cs** ,located in the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project.

  >**Note:** The BlueYonderResolver class implements the IDependencyResolver interface.

2. Locate the **GetService** method, and add the following code after the comment // TODO: Lab 4: Exercise 1: Task 2.1: Add a resolver for the LocationsController class.

   ```cs
        if (serviceType == typeof(LocationsController))
            return new LocationsController(new LocationRepository());
```
3. Press Ctrl+S to save the changes.

#### Task 3: Register the dependency resolver class with HttpConfiguration

1. In Solution Explorer, expand the **BlueYonder.Companion.Host** project. Expand the **App\_Start** folder, and then double-click **WebApiConfig.cs** to open it.

2. Add the following code at the beginning of the **Register** method to map the dependency resolver to **BlueYonderResolver** :

   ```cs
        config.DependencyResolver = new BlueYonderResolver();
```
3. Press Ctrl+S to save the file.
4. In Solution Explorer, under the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project, open the **LocationsController.cs** file.
5. Click the first line of code in the constructor method, and then press F9 to add a breakpoint.
6. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **BlueYonder.Companion.Host** project, and then click **Set as StartUp Project**.
7. Press F5 to run the app.
8. After the browser opens, append the string **Locations** tothe address in the address bar and press Enter. The address should be: **http://localhost:9239/Locations**
9. Switch back to Visual Studio and make sure the code breaks on the breakpoint.
10. Move the mouse cursor over the constructor&#39;s parameter and verify it is not null.
11. Press Shift+F5 to stop the debugger.
12. In Solution Explorer, expand the **Tests** folder, expand the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers.Tests** project, and then double-click **LocationControllerTest.cs**.
13. Locate the **Initialize** method and examine its code. The test initialization process uses the **StubILocationRepository** type,which was auto-generated with the **Fakes** framework. This stub repository mimics the real location repository. You use the fake repository to test the code, instead of using the real repository, which requires using a database for the test. When running unit tests, you should use fake objects to replace external components, in order to reduce the complexity of creating and executing the test.

  >**Note:** For additional information about Fakes, see: [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=298770&amp;clcid=0x409](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=298770&amp;clcid=0x409)

14. On the **Test** menu, point to **Run** , and the click **All Tests**.
15. Ensure that the test passes and then close the Test Explorer window that opened.

>**Results** : You will be able to inject data repositories to the controllers instead of creating them explicitly inside the controllers. This will decouple the controllers from the implementation of the repositories.

### Exercise 2: Adding OData Capabilities to the Flight Schedule Service

#### Task 1: Add a Queryable action to the flight schedule service

1. In Visual Studio, on the **Tools** menu, point to **Library Package Manager** , and then click **Package Manager Console**.

2. In the Package Manager Console, type the following command, and then press Enter.

   ```cs
        install-package Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.OData -version 4.0.30506 -ProjectName BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers
```
3. Wait until the Package Manager Console finishes downloading and adding the package.

  >**Note:** The current version of the **Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.OData** NuGet package has some incompatibilities with the version that was used when developing this course.  
Therefore, you are required to use the Package Manager Console to install the supported version of this package. **â€‚**

4. In Solution Explorer, expand the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project, and double-click **LocationsController****.cs**.
5. Decorate the **Get** method overload, which has three parameters, with the following attribute.

   ```cs
        [Queryable]
```
6. Remove the three parameters from the **Get** method and replace the **IEnumerable** return type with the **IQueryable** type. The resulting method declaration should resemble the following code.

   ```cs
        public IQueryable<Location> Get()
```
7. Replace the implementation of the method with the following code.
   
   ```cs
        return Locations.GetAll();
```
8. Press Ctrl+S to save the file.

#### Task 2: Handle the search event in the client application and query the flight schedule service by using OData filters

3. On the **File** menu, point to **Open** , and then click **Project/Solution**.
4. Browse to D:\AllFiles\Mod04\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Companion.Client.
5. Select the file BlueYonder. Companion.Client.sln and then click Open.
6. If you are prompted by a **Developers License** dialog box, click **I Agree**. If you are prompted by a **User Account Control** dialog box, click **Yes**. Type your email address and a password in the **Windows Security** dialog boxand then click **Sign in**. Click **Close** in the **Developers License** dialog box.

  >**Note** : If you do not have a valid email address, click Sign up now and register for the service.

7. Write down these credentials and use them whenever an email account is required.
8. In Solution Explorer, expand the **BlueYonder.Companion.Shared** project, and then double-click **Addresses.cs** file.
9. Locate the declaration of the **GetLocationsWithQueryUri** property, change it to access the locations service by using OData query and replacing the returned value with the following code.

   ```cs
        GetLocationsUri + "?$filter=substringof(tolower('{0}'),tolower(City))";
```
10. Press Ctrl+S to save the file.

>**Results** : Your web application exposes the OData protocol that supports the **Get** request of the locations data.

        using System.Net;
        using System.Net.Http;
        using System.Web.Http;
```
4. Replace the class declaration with the following code.

   ```cs
        public class ModelValidationAttribute: ActionFilterAttribute
